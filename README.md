This repository contains exercises that demonstrate different ways to build reactive applications, from using common building blocks such as Reactive Streams and RxJava to employing holistic frameworks such as Lagom from Lightbend. In this up-to-your-elbows-in-code session, you can experiment with various approaches so youâ€™ll leave with a clear understanding of what reactive programming is and what tools you can use to build reactive applications with Java.

**Pre-work:**

Clone this repo and run `mvn package`:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/IBM/reactive-code-workshop.git
$ mvn package
```

This will download all dependencies, and do some quick verification to ensure you're good to go for the workshop.

Come prepared with the Java IDE of your choice: Eclipse, IntelliJ, VSCode, emacs or vi if you must.

**See you on Tuesday!**
